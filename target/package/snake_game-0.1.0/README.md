# Snake Game in Rust

A simple terminal-based **Snake Game** built in **Rust** with no external dependencies.

This game lets you control a snake to collect food while avoiding collisions with itself and the walls. The game is displayed on a grid, where your snake grows longer each time it eats food.

### Features

- **Pure Rust**: No dependencies, using `SystemTime` for randomness.
- **Terminal-based**: Fully interactive console game.
- **Dynamic Scoring**: Your score increases as you eat food, and it's displayed at the top.
- **Controls**: Use `w`, `a`, `s`, and `d` to control the snakeâ€™s movement. Press `q` to quit.
